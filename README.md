-  Hi, Iâ€™m bennyhsu ðŸŒ±
- Iâ€™ve always wanted to work in the marketing field, especially on data-driven marketing. Because I have a passion for it and think it has a lot of potential.
  In the past few years in the workplace, I was engaged in data analysis work. This allowed me to get hands-on experience about what works and what doesnâ€™t.
  In this period of time, I successfully launched three data projects that bring great business benefits to the company

-  Iâ€™m currently learning Python and then I have the knowledge and skills not only to develop business insights 
   but also work across functional teams and define key operational metrics and dashboards to increase operational efficiency.
